3D Scene Segmentation & Detection
Part A
● Load stereoscopic images of scenes. Prefer scenes with large planar areas with large objects on
them, such as cars.
● Use the stereo images to generate disparity maps and convert them to point clouds (P1).
● Apply denoising algorithms of your choice to improve the quality of the scene
Part B
● Load a second point cloud directly (P2).
● Apply planar detection algorithms of your choice to detect and remove points that belong to
large planar areas (walls, floor) to both point clouds. Comment on the differences
● Perform clustering to the remaining points to group points that belong to the same object.
Devise a criterion to keep only clusters that are actual objects. Show their bounding boxes.
● Turn the planar areas and clusters into virtual objects, by calculating their bounding box/convex
hull. Throw a sphere and simulate its trajectory, performing collision detection with the objects
you created.
● Perform object-based triangulation.
